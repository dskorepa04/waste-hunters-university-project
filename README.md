# waste-hunters-university-project
This project was developed as part of a group effort with four team members. The topic of our semester project focused on Responsible Consumption and Production, inspired by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 12). The goal of the semester project was to create a console-based text game that encourages sustainable practices and raises awareness about responsible consumption.
